## Introduction

This project aims to optimize the management of product data in online stores. It includes functionalities for real-time display, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and efficient product searches using Binary Search Trees.

## Features

- **Real-time Product Information:** Display comprehensive product details immediately upon data initialization.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculate average prices and identify the most expensive product for informed decision-making.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Estimate discounted prices to assist in pricing strategies.
- **Binary Search Trees (BST):** Organize and search through product data efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following tools:

- **C Compiler (GCC):** To translate C code into executable binaries.
- **IDE (Visual Studio Code):** For code development, debugging, and project management.

## Usage
Run the program to initialize product data and perform real-time display, statistical analysis, and predictions.
The Binary Search Tree is utilized for efficient product searches.
## Binary Search Trees
The project incorporates Binary Search Trees for organized and quick product searches. The implementation includes functions for creating nodes, inserting products, and searching for products in the BST.
